To Run the server:
	1) Navigate to the "Server" directory
	2) Run "java -jar our-server.jar"
	Note - We did NOT use ant to package our server so any call to ant will not work.  The above command will work.


To Run the client:
	1) Navigate to the "Client" directory
	2) Run "java -jar catan-client.jar"

Saving games:
	If no games have been saved, then the first saved game will create a new "saves" directory in the "Server" directory that 
	all saved games will be saved to.
