Having two players in joinGame state looking at the list of games and one player creates a new game.  Does the other player have the option to create a new game?

When two logged in players create a game, the nubmers of the listed game get out of order

Playing a game with one person and 3 AI often skips the rolling state

Top bar should be color of the player, I think (TurnTracker.java initFromModel())
