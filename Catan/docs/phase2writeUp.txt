1. Write a document explaining the following aspects of your design:
-Explain in detail how you will implement the Observer pattern in your Model.
-Explain in detail how you will use the State pattern to change the behavior of your
MapController depending on the current game state. What are the different
states? What will be the MapControllerâ€™s behavior in each state?

2. Create the following two UML sequence diagrams:
-Create a sequence diagram that shows in detail how the Server Poller will
periodically update the client Model. Be sure to show how the GUI gets updated
to reflect the new state of the Model.
-Create a sequence diagram that shows in detail what your program will do when
a player places a road. Start the diagram at the point where the user clicks to
place the road, and end the diagram by showing how the GUI gets updated to
display the newly placed road.
